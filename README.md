Obesity is a prevalent issue in the U.S. The prevalence of obesity is increasing over the decade.
Many underlying risks can lead to a critical health problem. Moreover, obesity is also a potential
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Recent advances in wearable motion sensor
technologies offer an opportunity to translate laboratory ndings to the clinical environment with
similar gait balance measures. Inertial measurement units (IMU) combine accelerometers, gyroscopes,
and magnetometers into a single sensor and could be used to estimate COM acceleration. The use
of wearable sensors to detect mobility impairments has grown rapidly and provides a time-efficient
and user-friendly measurement of gait and balance performance. The IMU is placed at COM's proxy
location. This project aims to investigate whether the gait pattern would change in an individual with
obesity. We hypothesized that obesity could be detected by using the COM acceleration data from
self-selected speed walking.
